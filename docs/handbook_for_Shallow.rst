Mode of Bearing Capacity Failure
--------------------------------
A failure caused by the vertical and lateral displacement of foundation soils due to lack of sufficient strength is called a "Bearing Capacity Failure".

- General Shear

  : The configuration of the ultimate bearing capacity failure, with well-defined Terzaghi's shear planes developing and extending to the surface, is called "general shear".

- Local Shear

  : In some cases, the failure planes do not extend all the way to the ground surface.

- Punching Shear

  : In some cases, failure involves vertical compression beneath the footing without bulging of the soils.
