Mode of Bearing Capacity Failure
--------------------------------
A failure caused by the vertical and lateral displacement of foundation soils due to lack of sufficient strength is called a "Bearing Capacity Failure".

- General Shear

  : The configuration of the ultimate bearing capacity failure, with well-defined Terzaghi's shear planes developing and extending to the surface, is called "general shear".

- Local Shear

  : In some cases, the failure planes do not extend all the way to the ground surface.

- Punching Shear

  : In some cases, failure involves vertical compression beneath the footing without bulging of the soils.
  

Terzagi's bearing capacity
--------------------------

q_ult = c Nc + q Nq + 0.5 G B Ng

Soil Type
..........

  - Cohesive soils (phi=0): c*(2+pi) + q*1 + 0
  - Non-Cohesive soils: The embedment effect is particularlyimportant.

Correction Factors
...................

  - Footing shape
  - Ground water table
  - Embedment depth
  - Sloping

Local or Punching Shear
.......................

  - c* = 0.67 c
  - phi* = 1/tan(0.67*tan(phi))
